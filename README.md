# Bomb-Squad
This is a project I created using JS/CSS/HTML. 

Inspiration came from an article in Vice about another git user who created a 1000 grid layout of a Minesweeper game. But, my goal was to make a version of Minesweeper based almost completely on user input. 

JQuery and other JS-based librariers were avoided, as I wanted to see how hard it would be to build with just vanilla JS.

The most challenging tasks required several late nights where I worked through errors in my logic while ingesting and learning about different algorithm techniques.

The biggest obstacle was developing an algorithm for the "adjacent empty cells" function, where clicking an empty cell sets off a chain reaction. The solution turned out to be simpler than I expected and was just a matter of using an additional array so I could reprsent the board in two different states. Reading about binary node trees and related patterns of microbe growth helped me better understand what was happening.
