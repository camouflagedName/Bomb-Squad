# Bomb-Squad
This is a project I created to aid in learning JS, CSS, & HTML. Thus, most of the code may feel inconsistent or patched together. 

Inspiration came from an article in Vice about another git user who created a 1000 grid layout of a Minesweeper game. But, my goal was to make a version of Minesweeper based almost completely on user input. 

The game proved to be simple enough that I could complete "on my own" (with the aid of StackOverflow, of course), while providing enough complexity to learn about more advanced topics in JS.
JQuery and other JS-based librariers were avoided, as my goal was to develop a strong understanding of vanilla JS before diving into popular libraries.

The most challenging tasks required several late nights where I worked through errors in my logic while ingesting and learning about different techniques.

I struggled the most to create an algorithm for the "adjacent empty cells" function, where clicking an empty cell sets off a chain reaction. Wrapping my head around this took a few months, until I finally accepted that storing information in an array and iterating through that was the best solution. Reading about binary node trees and microbe growth helped me better understand what was happening.
