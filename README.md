# Bomb-Squad
This is a project I created to aid in learning JS, CSS, & HTML. Thus, most of the code may feel inconsistent or patched together. 

Inspiration came from an article in Vice about another git user who created a 1000 grid layout of a Minesweeper game. But, my goal was to make a version of Minesweeper based almost completely on user input. 

The game proved to be simple enough that I could complete "on my own" (with th aid of StackOverflow, of course), while providing enough complexity to learn about more advanced topics in JS.
JQuery and other JS-based librariers were avoided, as my goal was to develop a strong understanding of JS before diving into popular librariers.

Most of the challenging tasks required a few nights of working through errors in my logic while ingesting all of the new information I was learning. 

But, then I struggled the most with creating an algorithm for the adjacent empty cells function. Wrapping my head around this took a few months, until I finally accepted that storing information in an array was the best solution. Reading about binary node trees helped guide my thinking.
